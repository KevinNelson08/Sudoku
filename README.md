# Sudoku

**Version 1.0.0**
Python 3.9.12
Tkinter 8.6

This game was a way for me to sharpen up my skills and experiment with Python and tkinter.  The project force me to try several thing before finding what work and what I liked best. I did not want to make a simple sudoko puzzle solver but one where the user can play the game and solve the puzzle. This help me learned Python and tkinter. 


This is a simple GUI sudoku game.

In the menu, it has a play button which will generate a random board. 
A quit button to exit the game. 

In the game, users can only input one number and cannot take any notes in the game. They can check to see if they have the rigth solution. There is an option to see the solution if they are stuck. If you get tired of the puzzle, you could quit the puzzle and hit play again if they want to start a new puzzle.
